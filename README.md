## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I didn't use any outside resources.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
My biggest challenge in completing this game was understanding the audio section. I have never used the AudioContext library and I enjoyed 
reading the article and going through the code. It was interesting being able to create something that can generate sound like this. However,
when I was starting it was really difficult and it took me some time to understand the code. I was having a hard time with the sound synthesis
functions and how it was starting and stopping the tone. I wanted to know all the intricacies of the code I was writing, but when it came to 
the audio, I was stumped. I overcame this by reading the article that was provided and going through each part multiple times. Whenever 
I come across something I don’t understand, much like the AudioContext library, I found that reading through articles and watching videos 
helps to cement the concepts. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
The questions I had during the pre-work were answered through just rereading the assignment. It was very well written 
and hard to misunderstand any details. However, I think my general questions about Web development are in regards to 
the different technologies that will be used in the program and the technologies that are used in the industry. I’d love 
to know what technologies are standard in Web development and do those correspond to what will be introduced in the program. 



4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours, I would have loved to make the game as close in style to the real Simon says game. Instead of having the square buttons, I would recreate the circular game from 1978. It would have 
been really cool to add those features and see almost an exact replica.
